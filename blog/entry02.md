# Entry 2: Software and Hardware devices in medicine
##### 11/7/2024

## Context
After deciiding on my career, I researched software and hardware devices that doctors use during their jobs. For example, I found devices like:
```
-The first device was a Resonance Imaging which was an MR Device
  -This device is an MRI device that is used to create detailed pictures of the body.
-The second hardware is an Ultrasonography (USG) Device
  -The USG device, known as ultrasound, is used to examine invisible changes in the human body.
-The third most common device in medicine is the X-ray device
  -X-rays are used for tissue and bone imaging in hospitals. The inside of the body is visualized with X-rays.
-The fourth hardware device is a Vaccine Refrigerator.
  -This hardware device is used as a very important device for laboratories and pharmacies. Vaccines and serums can be stored in vaccine cabinets at a certain temperature. Vaccine cabinets are essential for cold chain application, which is very important for vaccines.
-The fifth hardware device is the Angiography device.
  -The process of imaging body vessels is called angiography. The drug containing the contrast agent that makes the veins visible is injected into the body and imaging is performed with the angiography device. 
-The sixth hardware device is the Defibrillator Device
  -The defibrillator device is defined as an electro-shock device. This device, which is used to deliver high currents for a short time, stops the abnormally fast beating of the heart and allows it to return to the normal heart rate.
```
To find these hardware devices, I had to research some information on google. My main search was "Hardware devices in Medicine". After researching some websites and articles, I came across a website titled: "[13 Hardware Devices In Medicine](https://coolermed.com/medical-devices-used-in-hospital/)". This link gave me different hardware devices that doctors use and a small gist of their main use. Another link that I looked at gave me [more information on medical devices](https://openmedscience.com/what-are-medical-devices-types-regulation-and-future-trends/) This website contained a variety amount of topics on medical devices and provided an excessive amount of information. I have been looking at more information about medicine and how the devices used can affect patients.

## Engineering Design Process
I'am currently in stage 2 of the Engineering Design Process (EDP). This stage in EDP is about researching the problem. I have been, and still am, researching my problem of medicine. My main problem about medicine used to be what career to exactly choose. Adding on to this idea, I'am researching about the devices that different types of doctors in medicine use. This helped me understand the gist behind the different careers and how doctors use these hardware devices effectively.

## Skill reflection
A skill that I used on my last entry was time management. This skill was very essential to me as I have many priorities to committ to. After finishing all of my homework after school, I decided to continue researching about medicine. I did this on the days that I am free on. For example, I'am currently busy on sunday's, tuesday's, and friday's. For this reason, I reasearch about medicine on days that I'am not busy like monday's, wednseday's, and thursday's. Saturday is a break day to catch up on anything I'am missing and just chill.
