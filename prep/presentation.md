# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* I will hook the people by introducing advanced inventions in an Aframe model that can be used in Medicine. These inventions are very interesting to know about so the people will definitely get hooked.

## Product
* My product will be about future inventions such as the pill dispenser that easily dispenses pills within one press of a button. They can experience this through an Aframe interactive model of the pill dispenser.

## Process
* MVP: information about pill dispenser
* Beyond MVP: Interactive Aframe model of invention
* Code Snippets of MVP and Aframe models

## Conclusion
* [https://mohameda4333.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/]
* Takeaways
* More inventions can be made to help support doctors in treating patients
* The Aframe model helps the user understand every part of a medicine invention through interacting with it.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
