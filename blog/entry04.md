# Entry 4: A-frame
##### 2/28/25

### Content

The tool that I chose is A-frame. It is a common but very interesting website as it explores through different models and pictures as someone would see in virtual reality. The image is 360 degrees and the UI is responsive to the input of the mouse. The website is extremely creative as it provides models that you can physically explore with the mouse. I tinkered with this website by looking at different models and images. I held the right side of the mouse to look around a 360 degree image or video. Similar to a virtual reality headset, you can look around and see the different parts of a 3d model all around the screen. For example, the image below shows a responsive 360 degree image that can be explored by just moving your mouse.
