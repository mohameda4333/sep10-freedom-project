# Entry 3: Part B of Hardware devices in Medicine
##### 1/2/25

### Content

For this project, I chose to explore how hardware devices play an essential role in the field of medicine. The aspects of both medicine and technology is very interesting, and I wanted to understand how these devices impact a doctors ability to diagnose and treat patients effectively. The two sources that helped me decide on this topic were ["Is being a Doctor Worth It"](https://www.sgu.edu/blog/medical/is-being-a-doctor-worth-it/) by St. George’s University and [“Reasons Why Studying Medicine is an Amazing Career Choice”](https://qiu.edu.my/7-reasons-why-studying-medicine-is-an-amazing-career-choice/) by Quest International University. For FP part B, I firstly decided to sort them in rows based on how common the devices were to society as shown below:
```list
The 3 most common known hardware devices in Medicine:			
– The most common known device in 		
medicine is the X-ray device				
X-rays are used for tissue and bone
imaging in hospitals. The inside of the body is 
visualized with X-rays.
– The second hardware is an
 Ultrasonography (USG) Device
The USG device, known as ultrasound, 
is used to examine invisible changes in
 the human body.
– The first device was a Resonance 
Imaging which was an MR Device
This device is an MRI device that is 
used to create detailed pictures of the 
Body.
```

However, this idea didn't seem very interesting because it didn't explore further into the topic to create a better organization. My second idea was to seperate these devices under 4 small topics as shown below:
```list
1. Imaging Devices:

MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Device

Purpose: Creates detailed images of internal organs and tissues using magnetic fields and radio waves.
Common Uses: Detecting tumors, brain disorders, spinal cord injuries.
Key Features: Non-invasive, no radiation.
X-Ray Device

Purpose: Visualizes bones and tissues inside the body using X-rays (a type of radiation).
Common Uses: Diagnosing fractures, infections, and bone disorders.
Key Features: Fast, effective for bone imaging, uses radiation.
Ultrasonography (USG) Device

Purpose: Uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of internal organs.
Common Uses: Monitoring pregnancy, diagnosing issues with organs (e.g., liver, kidneys).
Key Features: Non-invasive, safe, real-time imaging.
2. Therapeutic Devices:

Defibrillator Device

Purpose: Delivers an electrical shock to restore normal heart rhythm.
Common Uses: Cardiac arrest, arrhythmias.
Key Features: Portable, life-saving in emergencies.
Angiography Device

Purpose: Provides images of blood vessels to detect blockages or abnormalities.
Common Uses: Diagnosing cardiovascular issues, planning treatments like stent placement.
Key Features: Contrast dye used for clear imaging of blood vessels.
3. Monitoring and Diagnostic Devices:

ECG (Electrocardiogram) Device

Purpose: Measures electrical activity of the heart.
Common Uses: Diagnosing heart diseases, monitoring heart function.
Key Features: Portable, non-invasive, real-time data.
Pulse Oximeter

Purpose: Measures oxygen levels in the blood.
Common Uses: Monitoring respiratory conditions (e.g., asthma, pneumonia).
Key Features: Non-invasive, quick readings.
4. Support and Storage Devices:

Vaccine Refrigerator
Purpose: Stores vaccines at required temperatures to maintain efficacy.
Common Uses: Vaccine storage in hospitals, clinics, pharmacies.
Key Features: Temperature-controlled, essential for vaccine preservation.

### Sources

The website ["13 Hardware Devices in Medicine"](https://coolermed.com/medical-devices-used-in-hospital/) provided a large list of devices, including MRIs, X-rays, and ultrasound machines.
The article [“What Are Medical Devices”](https://openmedscience.com/what-are-medical-devices-types-regulation-and-future-trends/) from various educational sources helped me understand how these devices are used in modern healthcare.
Additional resources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and AAMC helped me learn about medical careers and the tools used by healthcare professionals.

### Engineering Design Process (EDP): Current Stage and Next Steps

In the Engineering Design Process (EDP), I am currently at the "finalizing" stage, where my research of the hardware devices are being exemplified in this blog. The next stage will involve refining the content for the website, making sure that it is structured nicely with a good amount of information. The next step is preparing to present this blog professionally online.

### Skills

Throughout this project, I have developed several skills:

Research Skills: I have learned how to effectively gather and explain information from multiple sources, making sure the information I present is both accurate and relevant.
Writing Skills: I’ve focused on making my writing clear and informative. By breaking down difficult concepts into easy language, I’m improving my ability to communicate technical information.
### Professionalism

While typing this blog, I have made sure to use proper formatting and structure to make it professional and readable. I’ve used headings, lists, and bold/italic text for emphasis, and I copied and pasted this work on a google doc to make sure that it is free of typos and grammatical errors. 

### Conclusion

The future of hardware in medicine is extremely fun and interesting, with evolution continuing to improve the way healthcare professionals diagnose and treat patients. Devices like MRIs, X-rays, and ultrasound machines are great examples to show the potential that technology holds for medicine. By understanding how these devices work, I’ve gained a deeper understanding for the role technology plays in medicine, and I’m excited to continue exploring this career.
