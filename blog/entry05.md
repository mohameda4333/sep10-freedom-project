### Context

After doing some research and trying things out myself, I gained a lot more knowledge about my tool and how to use it. My tool that I am using for the freedom project is Aframe. I tinkered with it a lot from last time. For instance, I watched different videos on youtube that helped me understand more about Aframe and the code behind it. [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) has many primitives that are kind of like components or models that I can use in my code. It has primitives such as:

```
- <a-box>
- <a-cone>
- <a-camera>
- <a-circle>
- <a-cursor>
- <a-cylinder>
```
These examples are primitives built within Aframe to add components that will make the website/model look way better. I tinkered with these primitives by adding different primitives to my model and changing their size, position, and shape. For instance, I added a plane by using the code `<a-plane>`. The plane was the main platform that everything depended on. It looks like a flat surface depending on where u place it. I change the length and width of the plane to make it a lot bigger so that all of the other primitives that I add can stay on it. My first model that I tried to edit was some simple shapes first with a change in the background color that looked like a sky. I added the plane and the models by first positioning them to their exact spot. Then I changed the background color through the primitive `<a-sky`. After I fully understood the priimitives on basic models, I tried tinkering with more complex models. However, I tried different primitives such as lighting. I added `<a-light type="point" intensity="2" position="2 4 4"></a-light>` as an example code that adds lighting to change the models appearance. But instead of tinkering with the code, I tried someething different. I used the Aframe inspector to change the models live and I experimented with lighting, positioning, and etc.

### Engineering Design Process (EDP)

In the Engineering Design Process, I am currently in stage 5 where I am creating the prototype. I have already did a lot of research on Aframe and I planned the solution of understanding the complex models of Aframe. Now I am trying to create an example prototype of Aframe so that I can make a new model with the skills I gained from using Aframe. The next stage in the Engineering Design Process is to test and evaluate the prototype. Although I am still working on creating the prototype, I plan to think about how I can asure myself that the model I made with Aframe is similar to what I learned and has a similar feeling of a Virtual Reality experience.

### Skills

Some skills that I gained from tinkering with Aframe is How to Learn and Creativity.

## How to learn

Tinkering with Aframe helped me understand how to learn on my own. It encouraged me to watch videos and look at useful websites that helped me understand more about Aframe especially when I was confused. I tried researching more about problems that I encountered while trying to edit Aframe code which was an overall skill that I gained as it encouragerd me to learn without anyones help.

## Creativity

To tinker with Aframe is to be creative. Every coder has to be creative as they make different websites. Similarly, any coder that makes models with Aframe has to be a lot more creative. For instance, if someone is creating a model, they need to make it original and have different functions than what is shown in Aframe. This causes the user to be creative whenever they are creating a project. I gained this skill while learning more about Aframe as I attempted to create models on my own and have them behave in different ways.
