## Tool: **Aframe**

### 3/31/25:
* Today I tinkered with Aframe by trying to code 3D models by myself. For example, I went into the [Aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/models.html) 3D models page and I copied the code that is provided. Then I examined the outcome and decided to edit the code on my own.
* The example model that I tinkered with is shown below:

* I used this model and pressed the right click button and then clicked on `inspect`. This is how I easily edited the code. To do some small changes, I changed the style of the models and made the sphere a lot taller, for example:

* Then I tried making the platform a lot wider:

* This is how I edited and tinkered with the examples in the model.
* Then I decided to change the shapes themself. I wanted to edit the code of the cylinder and change it to a triangle.
* Then I wanted to edit the code of the box, and change it to a plane.
* However, when I changed the code, I noticed that the shapes that I edited were flat and 2D. I wanted them to be 3D. So I did some research online and I got the true code for the 3D shape that I want.
* Instead of `<a-triangle>`, I had to type `<a-tetrahedron>`.
* This was the result of the code:
