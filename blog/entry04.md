# Entry 4: A-frame

## Content

The tool that I chose is [A-frame](https://aframe.io/). It is a common but very interesting website as it explores through different models and pictures as someone would see in virtual reality. The image is 360 degrees and the UI is responsive to the input of the mouse. The website is extremely creative as it provides models that you can physically explore with the mouse. I tinkered with this website by looking at different models and images. I held the right side of the mouse to look around a 360 degree image or video. Similar to a virtual reality headset, you can look around and see the different parts of a 3d model all around the screen. Some examples arFor example, the image below shows a responsive 360 degree image that can be explored by just moving your mouse.

I chose Aframe as my tool for medicine because it is exactly what I want people to see. As Aframe uses 3d interactive models to tinker with, I also want to use those models from Aframe to create medicine samples. I will make a diagram of medicine and also make the diagram interactive so that the user can see what happens if a certain medicine is mixed with another medicine for example. I also want the user to be able to clearly observe the medicine and its aspects. For example, I will create an ibuprofen medicine and make it that if the label on the back of the medicine bottle is pressed with a mouse, the user can dig deeper into the ingredients, what it's used for, and the expiration date. This will make it a lot easier for users to understand more about medicine if the tool is clear, interactive, and fun.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

My current stage in the Engineering Design Process is researching the website. I'am currently watching more videos, looking at guides, and exploring the workshop to get more information on A-frame. I'am also still tinkering with different examples in A-frame and looking at the code to understand how to make a website responsive and how there are more to models than what is displayed on the screen. I also edited the code to change the size of certain objects in the model. The next stage in the Engineering Design Process is brainstorming possible solutions to understanding the physics behind responsive 360 degree models.

## Skills

Some skills I gained while tinkering with A-frame are creativity and attention to detail.

### Creativity

The reason that A-frame helped me learn to be creative is because that is surpasses the aspects of an average website that you find online. This website includes models that are interactive and vast. This is why creativity playes a big role in surpassing an average website. You need to be really creative to think about making a VR related website that can be explored on any other device.

### Attention to Detail

Another skill that I have learned while tinkering with A-frame is my ability to pay more attention to detail. Small things like the shadow of the object shows the completion of a 3d model on a website. I also payed more attention to the hand tracking that is required to continue tinkering. I kept trying to move around with my mouse but I had to turn on a visual inspector to scan my hands and react to the movement of my hands.
