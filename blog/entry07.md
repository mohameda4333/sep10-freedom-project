## Context

After sharing my elevator pitch to most of my classmates, I had some takeaways from my presentation of my elevator pitch. The main point I should improve on is talking more about my website itself and the code I used to make my website. I should also elaborate more on how I came up with my inventions for my freedom project. I already shared enough information about my main topic about medicine. However, I did not show enough information about my physical website and the code behind it. This was the first 10 points I thought of to plan to say to the judges based on my elevator pitch:
```
1. The topic of medicine
2. The idea of the brain scanner
3. My A Frame models of the pill dispenser and the brain scanner
4. Explain current invention
5. Explain future invention
6. Show pictures of inventions
7. Show and explain code
8. Talk about their use in medicine today
9. Talk about how I came up with the brain scanner
10. Talk about my creative idea of the aframe model.
```
My in-class presentation also helped me because it gave me some takeaways that will help me improve my next presentation. My main takeaway from my [medicine](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K3uT4nX3qnQb6nJr3vHw48lKqtXL5tSvXIFyzE1dKUw/edit) presentation was to elaborate more on each slide/topic. When I was sharing the information about my freedom project, I rushed throught the information assuming the audience already knew what my topic was about. This is a bad habit because it will cause most of the audience to be confused since I didn't explain my project very well. For example, When I was talking about my A-frame, I sprinted through it because it was just shapes that were put together to make an invention. But some of the audience had no idea what A-frame was so I had to share more about what my tool was. As a result, I plan to thoroughly explain every topic about my project. Another point I took away from my in-class presentation was to talk more about my code and my MVP (minimum viable product). While I was sharing my slides, I mainly talked about the overall topic of medicine itself, but I should have also shared more about my code and how I made my [website](https://mohameda4333.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/).
