            Medicine has always been a significant part of society as people look up to doctors as idols claiming to be very successful. However, people fail to study the inventions that doctors use to make them successful in their job on how to treat the patients. Many inventions and devices were specifically made to support doctors in their goal to heal their patients. Under this section, there is more specific information about each invention and a generated A-frame model that describes these inventions.

      <p>The first invention is the pill dispenser. This invention is very useful as it dispenses pills based on when you need to take them. For example, the pill dispenser can have 3 buttons that each have an empty container if the button is lifted. The pills can be put in that empty container. There can be one red button that says "morning". One yellow button that says "afternoon". And one green button that says "night". By simply pressing on one of the buttons, a pill is dispensed based on where the pill is and the time of the day. This invention is very easy to use and efficient for people who often forget to take their pills throughout the day.</p>
