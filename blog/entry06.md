## Context

My freedom project topic is about medicine. I created a website that shares all the information about medicine and the current/future inventions in society. To make [my website](https://mohameda4333.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/), I first started to build my MVP (minimum viable product). In the beginning, all I needed was the information that shapes what my entire project is about. At first, I made a simple navbar from bootstrap with no dropdown menu yet. Then I added the information. For example, I added a section that talks about the overview of medicine, a section that talks about the current inventions that we have today, and a section that talks about a possible current invention that can be created in the future. The current invention was the pill dispenser and how easy it is to simply press a button to drop a pill right to you. Although this invention is useful, it is not that significant. As a result, I tried to think of an invention that people would love. Even doctors would be astonished based on how easy it would be with this new invention. The new invention I came up with is the brain scanner. It is a machine that can scan a persons brain based on the waves that it recieves from the brain. It can be very useful for everybody. That is how I created most of the MVP. I simply added the information I had in different sections before I decided to style my website. Here is an example of my website at the MVP stage:

As you can see, I simply added the minimum information needed to build my website. However, even building just the MVP was hard. I faced many challenges while building my MVP. For example, when I was starting my website, I didn't know how to spread the information into different sections. When I added the information, the words would just build up on top of each other. I did some research and I came across the [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_text_divider.asp) website. This website helped me understand how to divide the text into seperate sections. I tried using this code but it was difficult to embed it into my code. So I watched a [youtube video made by dcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFzUVINwnFo&t=1s)that helped me understand how to have different sections of text as it mainly talks about the basics of HTML and CSS. After studying what the guy showed me, I edited my code so that before every section, I add this code:
```
<section id="overview" class="container mt-4">
</section>
```
This helped me split my paragraphs into sections while also putting them in a container of my custom size. This challenge took me a while to figure out because it is actually easier than I thought it was. While I was making the MVP of this website, I learned many things. Firstly, you should not stress projects that much. I am busy outside of school because I have other courses going on and this project placed a lot of stress on me because I thought it was very difficult. However, when I really started trying to learn the code and make the project, it started to become easier than I expected. The code was easier than it should be as well as my challenge of splitting paragraphs into sections. Another takeaway I got from this project is that you should finish your work on time. This problem was one of my biggest problems with this class because I would just be too lazy to do the work. But as time moved on, my work kept stacking over each other until it became too much. Especially since I have other classes including an honors class.

## Engineering Design Process

As of right now when I was making my project, I am in step 5 of the Engineering Design Process where I create the prototype. I have already researched a lot to code for my project. I planned my website with the wireframes I created and the timeline I came up with. Now, I started to create the prototpye. While I was making the website, I learned a lot more fundamentals about coding that refreshed my memory from what I have learned about this year. My next step in the Engineering Design Process is to test and evaluate the prototype. Now that I have created my website, I still need to test more attributes about it that I can improve for the future. For example, When I created the Aframe models for my website, I couldn't view one Aframe model at a time closely. I could view both at the same time which wasn't very interesting to look at. As a result, I will keep testing similar attributes of my website to improve my website in the future.

## Skills

Time management is a very essential skill that I learned
