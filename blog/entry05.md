### Context

After doing some research and trying things out myself, I gained a lot more knowledge about my tool and how to use it. My tool that I am using for the freedom project is Aframe. I tinkered with it a lot from last time. For instance, I watched different videos on youtube that helped me understand more about Aframe and the code behind it. [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) has many primitives that are kind of like components or models that I can use in my code. It has primitives such as:

```
- <a-box>
- <a-cone>
- <a-camera>
- <a-circle>
- <a-cursor>
- <a-cylinder>
```
These examples are primitives built within Aframe to add components that will make the website/model look way better. I tinkered with these primitives by adding different primitives to my model and changing their size, position, and shape. For instance, I added a plane by using the code `<a-plane>`. The plane was the main platform that everything depended on. It looks like a flat surface depending on where u place it. I change the length and width of the plane to make it a lot bigger so that all of the other primitives that I add can stay on it. My first model that I tried to edit was some simple shapes first with a change in the background color that looked like a sky. I added the plane and the models by first positioning them to their exact spot. Then I changed the background color through the primitive `<a-sky`.
