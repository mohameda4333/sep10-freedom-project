# Entry 1: Deciding on my Topic: Medicine/Doctor
##### 10/8/24

## Context

The topic that I chose for this project is medicine. The reason I chose this topic is because I find medicine very interesting and I want to make medicine to help people live a healthy life. Tracing back to the ancient times, people made medicine using natural materials such as plants, minerals, and animal parts. I'm very hooked to the intelligence behind making medicine and I want to experience making medicine and helping people as well. My final 2 backup ideas are computer science and being a pharmacist. The 2 links that helped me choose my topic are ["Is being a Doctor Worth It"](https://www.sgu.edu/blog/medical/is-being-a-doctor-worth-it/) by St. George's university (School of Medicine) and [Reasons why studying Medicine is an Amazing Career choice](https://qiu.edu.my/7-reasons-why-studying-medicine-is-an-amazing-career-choice/) by Quest International University. These articles really encouraged me to choose medicine because they helped me understand how much of an impact I can have on society if I pursue this career.

## Engineering Design Process

I'am currently in the first stage of the Engineering Design Process where my main goal is to define the problem. The current problem that I have is choosing a certain medicine path. For example, I'am thinking about becoming a Surgeon, but it is too risky and it takes too much time out of my day. I need this time to stay with my family at home. As a result, I'am looking for a certain path in Medicine that takes a fair amount of time and has a major impact on the world. The next stage is to research the problem. I intend to research about different types of careers in Medicine and find the one that I need.

## Skills

Some skills that I plan to use that I have learned on this blog are Time Management, and Embracing Failure.

#### Time Management

I have many commitments outside and inside of school. I have to pick my sister up every day that I don't have after-school. I pick her up Monday and Friday since I have after school on tuesday, wednseday, and thursday. I also have arabic class that I attend 3 days a week. Tuesday, friday, and sunday are the 3 days that I attend online arabic class on for 1 hour each class. I also intended to go to swimming classes every saturday but I had to cut it off so that I could more easily commit to my responsibilities. 

#### Embracing Failure

Pursuing my career of becoming a doctor and specializing in medicine is very hard so learning how to embrace failure is a big part of my skills. The reason that medicine is liked so much in society is because of it's impact, and how succesful someone needs to be to actually become a doctor. Medicine isn't an easy career to followw so I need to understand that at some point, I might fail. At that point, I will just have to embrace it and know that failure is a part of succeeding.

## Summary

My passion of becoming a doctor was an insipiration from my dad as he is a physical therapist and the soceity. My next steps will be to study and research more about this topic and continue to try my best to become a doctor.
