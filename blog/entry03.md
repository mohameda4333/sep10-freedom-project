### Content

For this project, I chose to explore how hardware devices play an essential role in the field of medicine. The aspects of both medicine and technology is very interesting, and I wanted to understand how these devices impact a doctors ability to diagnose and treat patients effectively. The two sources that helped me decide on this topic were ["Is being a Doctor Worth It"](https://www.sgu.edu/blog/medical/is-being-a-doctor-worth-it/) by St. George’s University and “Reasons Why Studying Medicine is an Amazing Career Choice” by Quest International University.

Sources: Research and Resources Used

Throughout my research, I used a variety of credible resources to gather information about medical devices. Some key sources include:

The website "13 Hardware Devices in Medicine" provided an extensive list of devices, including MRIs, X-rays, and ultrasound machines.
The article “What Are Medical Devices” from various educational sources helped me understand how these devices are used in modern healthcare.
Additional resources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and AAMC helped me learn about medical careers and the tools used by healthcare professionals.
By linking information from these resources, I was able to create a well-rounded picture of the critical role hardware devices play in the medical field.

Engineering Design Process (EDP): Current Stage and Next Steps

As I move through the Engineering Design Process (EDP), I am currently at the "finalizing" stage, where my research and understanding of the hardware devices are being translated into this blog. The next stage will involve refining the content for the website, ensuring that it meets the desired format and structure. This blog serves as a culmination of my research phase, and the next step is preparing to present it professionally online.

Skills: Developing Valuable Abilities

Throughout this project, I have developed several skills that are transferable to many other areas:

Research Skills: I have learned how to effectively gather and synthesize information from multiple sources, making sure the information I present is both accurate and relevant.
Writing Skills: I’ve focused on making my writing clear and engaging while ensuring it’s informative. By breaking down complex concepts into easy-to-understand language, I’m improving my ability to communicate technical information effectively.
Professionalism: Effective Presentation

In the development of this blog, I have ensured proper formatting and structure to make it professional and readable. I’ve used headings, lists, and bold/italic text for emphasis, and I’ve carefully proofread the content to ensure it’s free of typos and grammatical errors. By following these formatting practices, I can present my research and ideas in a clear, polished manner.

Conclusion: The Future of Hardware in Medicine

The future of hardware in medicine is incredibly promising, with new advancements continuing to improve the way healthcare professionals diagnose and treat patients. Devices like MRIs, X-rays, and ultrasound machines are just the beginning of the incredible potential that technology holds for medicine. By understanding how these devices work and their applications, I’ve gained a deeper appreciation for the role technology plays in healthcare, and I’m excited to continue exploring this field.
